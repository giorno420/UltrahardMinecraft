# Reporting a vunerability
In order to report a vunerability, ***do not make an issue or a pull request***. Either message me on my <a href="https://discord.com/users/587539085439008780" target="_blank">Discord</a> or my <a href="mailto:giornogiovannabusiness@gmail.com">email</a> and be as precise about the vunerability as possible.

I'll work on fixing it as soon as possible

Also, vunerabilities should be something that could really damage a person's entire server, which have this plugin, or use this plugin as a vendor to attack/gain access to a server containing this plugin
