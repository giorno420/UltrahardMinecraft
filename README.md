# UltrahardModeMinecraft
i originally made this for a youtuber but he pussied out because he didnt wanna pay for it so i just decided to make this open source so you can suffer in your own server!

## Features
 - Beds have a 1 in 100 chance of exploding as the nether is slowly merging with the overworld (not done since chunk generation mechanics require math and im just stupid)
 - All creepers are charged and explode without a charge effect, they just immediately go kaboom since thats how bombs work
 - All zombies are fast because its creepy (still being implemented)
 - All skeletons, strays and wither skeletons give you a withering effect, due to them being dead. They also have better stuff than they used to have
 - All cows, sheep, pigs, chicken and fish have a 1 in 2 chance of dying on spawn, hence your food source is halved
 - Each time you get close to something that is changed, it shows you a hint!
 - All Iron Golems attack you when you enter their proximity
 - All Endermen attack you when you enter their proximity
 - When you touch lava, your health is halved, and when you enter lava, you die, because thats realistic
 - All spiders are faster, since all the above wasn't creepy enough
 - You can't use iron tools until your XP Level is 5 or over it (working on this)

Message me on <a href="https://discord.com/users/587539085439008780">Discord</a> to use this on a video or something, or if you wanna hire me (Jaden-MAN please accept my offer)

## Note
This plugin is NOT DONE. When run with other plugins or too many people, this may have unexpected side effects. I do not know what those effects are since i dont have anyone to play with :(
