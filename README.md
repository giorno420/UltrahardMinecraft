# Ultrahard Mode Minecraft
i originally made this for a youtuber but he pussied out because he didnt wanna pay for it so i just decided to make this open source so you can suffer in your own server!

## Features
 - Beds have a 1 in 100 chance of exploding as the nether is slowly merging with the overworld. (not done since chunk generation mechanics require math and im just stupid)
 - All creepers are charged and explode without a charge effect, they just immediately explode.
 - All zombies are fast because its creepy.
 - All skeletons, strays and wither skeletons give you a withering effect, due to them being dead. They also have better stuff than they used to have.
 - All cows, sheep, pigs, chicken and fish have a 1 in 2 chance of dying on spawn, hence your food source is halved.
 - Each time you get close to something that is changed, it shows you a hint!
 - All Iron Golems attack you when you enter their proximity.
 - All Endermen attack you when you enter their proximity.
 - When you touch lava, you instantly die, because in real life, you can't really swim that way in lava
 - All spiders are faster, since all the above wasn't creepy enough.
 - You can't use iron tools until your XP Level is 5 or over it. (kinda scuffed)
 - You can't use diamond tools until your XP Level is 7 or over it. (kinda scuffed)
 - A regular zombie dying has a 1 in 50 chance of turning into a titan (a giant zombie. I'm gonna work on the zombie hostility AI soon)
 - Remember how mobs have better loot? Yeah, they will NEVER drop any of it, because the chances of them dropping their loot are 0%
 - All zombie pigmen attack you in proximity
 - You get "hungry" after you wake up :/

## Issues
Did you find an issue? Is your server completely fucked because of my plugin? Fear not, and follow the steps below!
1. Scream and cry at your messed server.
2. Open the server console and copy the traceback error.
3. Make an issue, and be as precise as you can about it. What were you doing when it messed up? Did it happen more than once? Copy and paste the error logs from the server console to your issue.
Or if you're smart enough to implement your own solution, please make a pull request for it!


## Note
This plugin is NOT DONE. When run with other plugins or too many people, this may have unexpected side effects. I do not know what those effects are since i dont have anyone to play with :(
